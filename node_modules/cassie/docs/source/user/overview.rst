Overview

Cassie is a short and self contained library that adds support for *Promises*
in JavaScript. It's designed to help people manage complex asynchronous
dependencies without getting all tangled up in callback messes and loosing the
composition power that JavaScript as a language provides. It's also designed to
be easily extensible, such that people can provide specialised promises for
more complex problem domains — for an example of that, see `Iris`_.

Why use it?
===========

JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous, top-down, left-right, strict
evaluated scripting language, but environments (specially `Node.js`_) provide
asynchronous functions to enable light-weight concurrency.

As such, `Event-Driven Programming`_ and `Continuation-Passing Style`_ have
become rather popular patterns when working in a JavaScript code-base. You ask
the engine to do something, but instead of blocking everything until that thing
is done, you just provide a ``Function`` that the engine should call once the
task is done so you can continue processing the data.

Unfortunately, this quickly leads to clusterfucks of callbacks, most of the
times::

    req.onreadystatechange = function(ev) {
      if (req.readyState == 4 && /2\d{2}/.test(req.status)) {
        var data = JSON.parse(req.responseText)
        next() }

      function next() {
        var item = data.shift()
        if (!item)  return

        view.insert(process(item))
        setTimeout(next, 100) }}

    setTimeout(req.abort.bind(), 10e3)


With promises, one could achieve this::

    var Promise      = require('cassie').Promise
    var sequentially = require('cassie/src/sequencing')

    req.then(JSON.parse)
       .timeout(10)
       .ok(function(data) { sequentially.apply(null, data.map(process)) })

    function process(item) { return function() {
      var promise = Promise.make()
      setTimeout( function() { var result = do_process(item)
                               view.insert(result)
                               promise.bind(result) }
                , 100)
      return promise }}


At first glance it doesn't seem to have changed much, although one could (arguably) say
that the *Promise* based example reads better. None the less, we can see some
improvements in the *Promise* based example:

  * Success and failure are properly separated, and are easily recognisable.

  * Process is now a ``Function`` over single items, that can be easily
    abstracted and combined — even though it's asynchronous.

  * Using the ``sequentially`` utility, we can do *Promise* based tasks in
    sequence, without dealing explicitly with ordering and success/failure of
    each task individually. Tasks just need to handle themselves —
    ``sequentially`` is just a wrapper over the lower level ``Promise#wait``
    method, that lets you declare dependencies between promises, so you can
    other kinds of control-flow logic.

  * ``then`` allows chaining of transformations over the bound value of a
    promise. In this case, we can separate the projection in an appropriate
    representation from the processing of such representation — loosing
    coupling and maximising composition of processes/function.


Promises do even better when we have to handle complex dependencies. For
example, if we should fire three different requests, in sequence, but only
firing the next if the previous hasn't failed, we could simply do::

    sequentially( post.bind(null, '/foo')
                , post.bind(null, '/foo/bar')
                , post.bind(null, '/foo/bar/baz'))
      .ok(console.log.bind(console, 'All requests successfully processed.'))
      .failed(console.log.bind(console, 'The following request failed:'))


Or, if we need to apply a transformation to one of the tasks and process it
later on::

    sequentially( with_logging(post, '/foo')
                , as_json(post.bind(null, '/foo/bar'))
                , post.bind(null, '/foo/bar/baz'))
    
    function with_logging(action, uri) { return function() {
      return action(uri).ok(console.log.bind(console, '[OK]', uri))
                        .failed(console.log.bind(console, '[FAILED]', uri)) }}

    function as_json(action) { return function() {
      return action().then(JSON.parse) }}


You get the idea.
                


Cool! How do I use it?
======================

Well, glad you asked, me dear, because we're just about to reach that part in
particular: "How do you use *Promises*?". As we answer that question, we'll
:doc:`dabble a little more in the concepts of Promises <getting-started>`
through usage scenarios.
