I'm looking at telepathy looking for out-of-the-wing interactions. Just thinking of being innovative, looking at things from a different perspective, original ideas, you know, some of the most exciting innovations really come from things that are actually rather simple plots that nobody really, from whatever reason, just never really occurred. Ah, creativity and enthusiasm. So whatever it is that they create, I want them to really own it, know what it is, be able to explain it, sell it well. You know, I want it to be something practical, you know, something you can really use and something that we can see, not just being discussed, but something really beautiful. Oh, okay, I like that. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. You bet. Thank you. You bet. You bet. Okay, all right.",1

6," So what exactly are hackathons? It's pretty much a social coding event that are hosted by organizations companies or even schools to bring programmers and other people who are interested in solving business problems together. The organizers of these events would provide themes for example healthcare and then you and other people with form teams together to collaborate some sort of software or program that would relate to the healthcare theme or even solve some problems within healthcare. And sometimes hackathons could be one day events. It could be spanning to three days where people are just coding 24-7, being hyped up on Red Bull and other energy drinks. At the end of it all you get to submit and present your ideas for a competition and earn prize money.",1
7," So I want a hackathon that led to an all expenses paid startup accelerator retreat. And today I want to talk about what a hackathon is, my experience with them and how to get involved. So a hackathon is just a space where people come together to build things with code. Usually it's over a weekend or over a couple of days and sometimes there are themes to the hackathon. For example, these could be like sustainability, they could be social good, and they can also be different tech things like AI, Web3, crypto, or anything like that. During a hackathon you usually work together with a team or by yourself to build an end result with code. And that could be something like an app, a website, a game, or anything that you can think of. During a hackathon though, there's much more than just coding. There's also usually workshops, so places where you can learn new skills. There's also games and events where you can meet the other people in the hackathon. And sometimes there are guest speakers that you can listen from and learn from. These speakers are usually industry professionals, mentors, or just other people who are interested in passionate about computer science. One misconception is that you have to know how to code to participate in a hackathon, but that's not true. In hackathons there are space for designers, project leaders, writers, anyone with a creative side. There are hackathons for people of all ages, including elementary, middle school, high school, college, and even beyond. The purpose of a hackathon is to learn new skills, meet people, and to build a project which can either be just for fun or if to put on your portfolio or resume. I did my first hackathon online last year through people from the code of classity community and we built an AR app that allows you to try on different manicure designs. One of the best ways to learn about upcoming hackathons is through major league hacking, which is a community and platform that post new hackathons all the time. Here is their website which you can find the 2024 hackathon season and a bunch of hackathon events coming up. If you're a university student, chances are your university or one near you will also host a hackathon. Hackathons can also be great ways to travel and go to other schools as many of them like Stanford's TreeHacks will fly you out to participate. Hackathon prices are usually really insane with a lot of them offering cash prices and other cool things like AirPods Pros. For example, at TreeHacks, which is Stanford's hackathon last year, they were giving out prices like $500 door dash gift cards and $250 dollar spa gift cards. Another great resource for teen hackers is hack club. They have a really powerful community and they also fly people out for hackathons. For example, this year they did a camping themed hackathon that was held in Vermont. I've really enjoyed the creative process of building cool projects with my friends at hackathons and I think they're a great way to meet new people and practice your skills.

9," Okay, so what are the benefits of chasing funding for your startup through accelerated programs and hackathons? Well, on the plus side, you might win the money, but there are also lots of other benefits around that. So, it's a great way to get your brand out there. It's a great way to get recognition. It's also a really good way to network in the wider ecosystem. So, if you're crypto startup, going to crypto, hackathons, going to crypto accelerator programs, it's a great way to meet really good people and find mentors. If you're also after a co-founder, that's the kind of place where you might just bump into them. Secondly, I'd also recommend you go to these things because it's fantastic practice. It's a pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch. Whether that's in the elevator on the way up, whether that's as part of the competition, you need to pitch, you need to pivot, and then you need to get back after the hackathon and then keep powering up. So, check them out. Happy hustling, like and follow for more.",1
10," Here, I'll share a few tips for finding hackathons that offer travel scholarships. Hackathons are an amazing opportunity for tech developers and tech enthusiasts to showcase their skills, learn new technologies and network with others. But for some like me, the cost of travel and accommodation can be a barrier to participating in these events. That's where travel scholarships come in. Many hackathons offer travel scholarships to participants to help cover the cost of their travel and accommodation. Here are some tips on how to find these hackathons and where to learn more about them. Tip number one, start your search early. The earlier you start your search, the better chance you have of finding a hackathon with a travel scholarship. Many hackathons have a limited number of travel scholarships available, so make sure to apply as soon as possible. Tip number two, check the hackathons website. Most hackathons have their information, including travel scholarships and details about them listed on their website. Check the website for more details on the travel scholarship and the application process. Tip number three, follow hackathon communities on social media. You can find and follow some of these communities on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to stay updated on some of their new hackathons and any opportunities like scholarship available. Tip number four is use search engines. You can use Google and even Twitter to find hackathons that offer travel scholarships. You can search terms like hackathon travel scholarship or travel scholarship hackathon 2023. That should give you a good starting point. And if there's a particular hackathon you want to attend, for example, like an eighth global hackathon, you can search for eighth global hackathon scholarships. So what are some of these popular hackathons that offer travel scholarship? Here are a few of my favorites that you should consider. There is majorly hacking Facebook's hackathons, Google Summer of Code, Microsoft's Imagine Cup, eighth global hackathons, get coin grants, and Web 3 Summit. There's a bunch of others too.

12," Come with me to our AI hackathon event in San Francisco. So we had over 300 people flying from all over the world to build products using the latest AI technology. The first two days consisted of the group formations, helpful workshops, building, and endless snacks. On the final day, I was a preliminary judge so I got to demo about 30 of the 90 projects submitted. The final judging happened on stage and two teams walked away with $10,000 checks each. Finally, we celebrated with a cocktail party back at our office.",1
13," In 2019, I led a team of three first semester computer science students to win the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society Hack for Education. And these are my top three tips for how to pitch a winning solution. And these tips are inspired by Simon Sinek's Start with Why. And that's our first tip. Number one, Start with Why. Why is your solution relevant, either from a technical perspective or from a societal perspective? Now usually a hackathon will start with a problem. And so the temptation may be just to restate the problem that you were given. But I think this is super lame because often the jury already knows what problem you've been given. What they want to see from you is how you interpret that problem, how you understand the problem from your own perspective and from the perspective of your team. So don't restate the problem that you were given, but reinterpret it in your own imagination and explain why your solution is relevant for that specific technical problem or social issue. Tip number two, how will your solution solve the problem? Now the tendency here is to go right into the functions of your solution and try to explain what it is that your solution does. But it's really important for the jury that you connect the ways in which your solution solves a problem. So it's not good enough to just go straight into what your problem does. You need to be able to explain how your problem creates value and in which ways it solves the problem that you talked about in the why. So you're going to have to move up one step from what your solution does to try to think on a higher level about how your solution solves a specific problem. And then finally what you've all been waiting for the last tip is all about the what. So number three, what specifically does your solution do? Now it's important here to be clear and concrete. A lot of times innovators try to hide behind creating solutions that do everything for everyone where they make implicit assumptions that they may not see but the jury can pick out very easily. So be very concrete, be very specific. And this means you're going to have to be brave. This means that if you think your solution can solve a very specific problem, you need to lean into that and spell it out for them. Show them in what concrete ways your solution solves that specific problem. So top three ways of making a pitch that'll help you win a hackathon. Number one, start with why. Number two, be able to articulate how your solution creates value. And number three, be able to specify what your solution does. And here's a bonus tip no matter how much time you're given, spend 20% of that time explaining the why, spend 30% of the time explaining the how, and use 50% of the time explaining the what. So if you've got a 10 minute pitch, two minutes on the why, three minutes on the how, five minutes on the what. Good luck, you're going to do amazingly well.",1
14," Last week, me and my friends got flown out and sent to an all-experienced paid startup accelerator retreat in Sun River, Oregon. And I want to talk about how we got here. So it all actually started this year in February when me and two of my dorm friends and co-ed with Closie alumni participated in Tree Hacks, which is Stanford's biggest hackathon. If you're unfamiliar with what a hackathon is, it's a place where sweaty, both fingertips and literally people come together to build cool projects with code. At Tree Hacks, students from all over the country got flown in for a really cool weekend of coding and creating together. The event was organized super well and it was held in our engineering building. At hackathons, people sleep there and code their the entire time so it is really intense. But the organizers take really good care of us, providing free food, water, snacks, and everything else you could need. My team members and I spent the entire week coding and of course my developer environment is pink themed. We had to stay filled on caffeine, of course. At a hackathon, there are tons of different prizes, like hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of prizes, and different categories depending on what you build. My friends and I ended up building a dating app that connects people based on their shared interest and matches them automatically on their first dates. We were so obsessed with our project that we even spent a night at the building to build it. It worked out in the end though because we won the most likely to become a business prize by Neo, which is the start of Accelerator, and they ended up flying us out for the retreat as a part of the park.",1
15," If you're planning on going to a hackathon soon here, three things you need to know. Number one, add the hackathon. You should try to use the language that you haven't used before, or framework you haven't used before, or something that you really want to improve on, because you'll have a lot of time to work with that language, and you'll improve a lot. Number two, where do you over it? I'm not kidding. In-person hackathons can sometimes smell bad depending on where you're sitting. And number three, just have fun regardless of whether it's online or in-person. You're going to meet new people, meet cool people, and do a lot of cool things, and it's going to be great time.",1

We have our image here, a nice sand dinner. We have our veggies, salmon, everything else and we see overall is great. We have wood protein, black and a little bit in fiber. But obviously we understand that not all images are gonna be saved on your computer. And so we made this a progressive web app so that it could be on your phone on the go whenever you need it. So we have the scan by app here. Same exact structure as it is and we'll just take a photo. A nice, healthy meal. We got our pasta chicken. It'll scan it over and in just one second it'll give us the feedback. Wow! And just so you know we didn't hard-code the values to be really good, we're gonna scan something that's maybe not the best. A little bagel for everyone. See when I was here in this morning I thought I was doing something good for my body. It turns out that it's lacking in almost everything. Unbelievable!

Hi, what's your name? My name is Matt. And what are you building today? We are building AI podcasting platforms.

Hi, what's your name? Benayak. And what are you building today? Yeah. So we're building this thing called Climanga. So it's basically like a chatbot and the chatbot you can answer it questions about climate change and it'll give you an answer from a trusted source with a citation and it'll even create like a manga for you which describes a doomsday scenario for what will happen if you don't improve or like if you don't get the government and like I guess companies to like get them to change their ways. So yeah. Hi, what's your name? Hi, I'm John Larkatrida. And what are you building today? Today we are building a semantic lensa which is kind of like a pre-send type pre-commit hook for everything that you send that's not code, emails, like messages, things like that where you can define some rules in natural language like you assert that people like or refer to products by certain names and then anything that you send internally and externally is checked by those rules using a large language model. Hi, what's your name? I'm Max. And what are you building? We're doing a disaster response system for people in the military and for responders. So the idea is for us to help first responders understand what's happening when a certain event happens.

So since we do this, you and I will take a camera and you can put an app, you might like somewhere in the area where you can see all the shots and everything and each track. All the shots you might see is how we go ahead and how we point some others things we can prove. Before you say that, how you're at more patient. The things we do is speed, arc, releasing and whether or not we're not going to know. Obviously all the time we did two models, one's like group detection, one's for shot classification, I've heard about the shot and then there were a lot of videos involved and it came to the speed and everything. There was a comfort thing where we had to figure out what we went through the hole because we didn't have actual circle inside. We were going through three holes. Yeah, but didn't you all use stable diffusion? Yeah, you know. Do you want to talk about that? That's what made it a little bit easier. Yeah, I think we saved a few things. I think a lot of people used it like we thought it would make all these things. I really cool use case, we used like a trained data for boots. We have a lot of data, we know how we take things, but there's something much more complicated, it's hard to find data. I think the stable diffusion is really cool. You can use that to add your data to that stuff. It's very information or what you're just putting that on the list. So yeah, you're just a little bit more patient.",1

Plus, by working on one project continuously for a whole weekend or whatever time period it is, you learn a lot of new information and you improve your skills and you end up having a cool side project to put on your portfolio. Of course, hackathons aren't for everybody because not everybody likes doing code for a whole weekend, but it is something you should try at least once in your life.

Look up online of the previous Capture the Flag questions or the previous competitions and see what the questions are like. And then look up the solutions because a lot... There are video solutions. I did some Capture the Flag contests like a Pico CTF back in high school. And in like previous years they do have like tutorials and how what they did to like break into the system to find the flag. What they did to create the scripts and stuff, stuff like that. So yeah, some of them are just bash scripting, some of them is Python scripting. Keep in mind these are not large programs or kind of just small programs you write. Break into the system. Some of them was C code as well. But yeah, if you do well and capture the flag, it does help a lot. I would recommend doing it in high school or college because it helps you in cyber security and you could stand out this way.

We were consisting of five students and myself where we worked on a project to create a media management system for the National Library Archives. Our project was equipped with artificial intelligence and large language models and it was a great experience. I specialized in data science and this opportunity expanded my horizons so I could see the applications of the skills in my field with other sectors like archives. It allowed me to utilize my past to help guide our future making decisions. A standout moment for me was when we had a fireball discussion with his excellency Abdelarra A.C. He talked to us about our nation's values and how we can utilize that to guide our future decision making. He also talked to us about Shia Zayed and his leadership style how he was informed about all sectors and how he cultivated other leaders. The opportunity was amazing. There were other universities involved so it was a challenge coming up with an innovative idea that stood out. However, we worked as a team and came out of the hackathon as winners. We've been there working on the problem that was given to us which is a developing system to manage the IUA historical data like the pictures, videos and the interviews of the leaders. So it was an interesting hackathon. We have a team who came up from the IWA University. We worked closely so overall it was a nice experience for me in the lab teach.",1

40," I had posted some TikToks that I would go to Empire City, Casino, and Yonkers. And I would be able to turn $500 into $30,000 playing digital backer app. And people are like, no way, dudes cap in, that's not possible. And those same people that were commenting probably never gambled a day in their life. Anyways, let me break it down for you, how I was able to win that much money so many times playing backer app. Now with digital backer app, there's no live dealer. It's just on a screen. Usually I would like to go with a bank role of like $2,500. But when I was desperate and had less, I would still go. And I would sit there watching the patterns on the screen, tells you what the last several outcomes of the last hands were. So I would wait until there was a definitive pattern. For instance, it was player player player, two bankers, and then a player I was realizing was 321. So I would keep betting on that pattern. But I wouldn't just make a small bet. I was going all in. Another thing I waited for was streaks. If I saw a player or banker going more than three or four hands in a row, winning, I would keep riding it until it lost. So say I put $800 on player every time until it eventually lost. Be some days where player would do 20 wins in a row. That's how I was able to win that much money in such a short time span. I think to play backer app the way I was describing it, have to have a lot of patience and you have to not be afraid to take in the risk when those streaks come.",1
